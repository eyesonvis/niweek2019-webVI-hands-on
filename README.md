# NIWeek 2019 Hands-On: Create Web-Ready User Interfaces with the LabVIEW NXG Web Module

This site contains the materials from a hands-on at NIWeek 2019 that shows how to create web applications that communicate with LabVIEW applications.

You can complete this hands-on if you have the following software:
- LabVIEW 2019

You'll also need the files from both the *LabVIEW 2019 code* and *LabVIEW NXG code* folders. If you're not familiar with git, simply click the *Clone or download* button and choose *Download ZIP* from the overlay panel.
